# üõãÔ∏è Laterna (Server)

Laterna is a lightweight REST api for sharing HEX color codes between 2 (or more) lamps with simple HTTP requests, written in go.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was developed with my own use case in mind.
> Expect bugs and weird annoyances/limitations, as this is my first REST api and my first time using go

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siestaw/laterna.git
cd laterna
```

### 2. Configure the server

Laterna requires a config.json in it's root directory. An [example config](https://github.com/siestaw/Laterna/blob/main/config.json.example) is provided

`$ mv config.json.example config.json`

You can leave the json as it is or configure it to your liking, although some configuration options (e.g. `verboseLogging`) aren't fully implemented yet.

### 3. Run

Make sure that go is installed. The server was tested with go 1.24.5 on linux.

`$ go run ./cmd/server`

or use the makefile:

`$ make run`
